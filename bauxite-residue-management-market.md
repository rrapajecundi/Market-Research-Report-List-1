<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bauxite Residue Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Stacking</li><li>Wet Storage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bauxite residue management primarily involves two types: dry stacking and wet storage. Dry stacking entails dewatering the residue and stacking it in engineered landforms, reducing water use and minimizing environmental impact. This method promotes stabilization and recovery of land. In contrast, wet storage involves slurrying the residue in containment areas, allowing for easier transport but increasing risks of leaks and contamination. Both methods aim to mitigate environmental risks while optimizing the long-term storage of bauxite residue from aluminum extraction.</p></p>
